# Tasker-SleepAsAndroid-Alarm-Reader
This task can read out the [alarm content provider](https://docs.sleep.urbandroid.org/devs/content_provider_api.html) from the SleepAsAndroid app.
Launching the app with launch data set will prompt it to read out the alarms, and subsequently send an intent with the data (which can then be processed within Tasker).
